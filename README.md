SMA Project – Skincare Review Analysis of Dot and Key Moisturizers

End‑to‑end Social Media Analytics capstone project by Divya Bothra focused on scraping, cleaning, and analyzing online skincare product reviews (moisturizers) using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.​

Project Overview
This project collects raw product reviews from web sources, cleans and preprocesses the text, performs word‑level frequency analysis, and applies basic NLP techniques such as POS and NER tagging to extract key themes and insights about moisturizers. The final outputs are structured Excel files and notebooks that can be reused for marketing analytics, sentiment exploration, and topic summarization.​

Repository Structure
Web_Scraping.ipynb – Notebook for scraping and assembling the raw reviews dataset into SMA_Dataset.xlsx and related files.​

SMA_Capstone_DivyaBothra -2.ipynb – Main analysis notebook covering cleaning, tokenization, POS/NER tagging, and word/topic summaries.​

Scraped Datasets/ – Raw scraped review data before cleaning and transformation.​

cleaned_reviews.xlsx and cleaned_with_tokens.xlsx – Processed datasets with cleaned text and token‑level information.​

Word Frequency Excels/ – Word and token frequency outputs for further analysis or visualization.​

NER + POS Tagging Files/ – Outputs from named entity recognition and part‑of‑speech tagging pipelines.​

topic_summary_by_moisturizer.xlsx – Topic and keyword summary aggregated at the moisturizer level.​

Data and Methods
Tech stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Excel for exporting intermediate and final datasets.​

Core steps:

Web scraping of moisturizer reviews from selected online sources.​

Text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization of review text.​

POS tagging and named entity recognition to highlight important entities and descriptors.​

Word frequency and topic‑style summaries at product level for marketing insights.​

How to Use
Clone the repository and open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.​

Start with Web_Scraping.ipynb if you want to replicate or extend the scraping; otherwise, use the provided Excel files as ready‑made inputs.​

Run SMA_Capstone_DivyaBothra -2.ipynb to reproduce the cleaning, NLP processing, and topic/word frequency outputs.​
